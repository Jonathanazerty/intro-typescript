# intro-typescript âœ…

- Install TypeScript globally on my system

- Used a config file, and adapted it so it compiles from my src folder to the public folder. 
- Ran tsc to compile the src JS file. 
- Loaded the result from the public folder in the index.html.

- Switched my source file to a TypeScript file. 
- Therefor needed to adapt the code for it to work again & checked for any errors coming up and fixed them.


Lastly, I used Webpack to compile a bunch of things (the styling, for example) instead of just TypeScript.
- Moved my application over to compile via webpack.
